## Python GUI Assignment (tkinter)

This is a follow up assignment to the Python Datascience assignment which we have already completed. In this assignment we will design a GUI using `tkinter` which would have the following overall functionality:

* The GUI would provide the user to select a file from the computer.
* It will have a dropdown menu to toggle between two output options: `Segmentation` and `Bounding-box`
* If `Segmentation` is selected then it should show the segmentation map of the selected image file along with the original image file side-by-side.
* For `Bounding-box` it should display the bounding boxes instead of the segmentation maps.
* We will obtain the segmentation maps and the bounding boxes by taking help from the previous assignment (which you have already done).

## Python Datascience Assignment

In this assignment we will deal with **Instance Segmentation and Detection**. Instance segmentation is a very well studied task of Deep Learning, having tremendous variety of applications. You have to create a python package for transforming images and analysing their effect on the predictions of an instance segmentor. We are providing you with a pretrained segmentor, all you need to do is to call the segmentor on the image and get the outputs.

A python package means that one can install the package in the python environment and can import the modules in any python script, irrespective of the location of the script. Creating a python package is fairly easy, just follow the steps [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
